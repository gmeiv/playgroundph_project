  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
   Playground was created by a team of passionate developers, gamers, and Computer Engineering students who believe that everyone deserves a space to unwind, have fun, and connect with others. Fueled by our love for technology and interactive entertainment, we set out to build a platform where users can enjoy a unique mix of engaging games and relaxing background music — all in one safe and welcoming environment.<br><br>

Our mission is to provide a digital escape that is not only enjoyable but also meaningful. Whether you're here to challenge yourself, bond with friends, or simply relax after a long day, Playground offers a variety of experiences tailored to your mood and interests.<br><br>

We are committed to continuous improvement, regularly adding new games, features, and updates inspired by your feedback and ideas. Thank you for being part of our growing community — your support means the world to us!
